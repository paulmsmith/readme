## 2018

Done. A pivotal year. Physical and mental health took a beating. Profesionally I "took my medicine" and came out the otherside with lots of lessons and personal development. With time and reflection I think this will have been a good year in general but it doesn't feel that way at 21:33 on 31st Dec 2018.

### Goals

Didn't set any. This was a mistake.
