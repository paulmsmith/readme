I'm leaving Well Digital in Jan 2019 for a fresh challenge. Can't wait to get started! 

## 2018

Done. A pivotal year. Physical and mental health took a beating. Profesionally lots of great things but I also worked on a real tough tranformation programme. I "took my medicine" and came out the otherside with lots of lessons and personal development. With time and reflection I think this will have been a good year but at 23:30 on 31st Dec 2018 I'm still sore from some mistakes I made and some tough situations I and my teams wound up in. 

### Goals

Didn't set any. This was a mistake.
